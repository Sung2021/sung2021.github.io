## About_Me
I am an experienced bioinformatician with extensive research experience in immunology and oncology. Currently working at Dana Farber Cancer Institution as a senior bioinformatician, I collaborate with multiple research labs and pharmaceutical companies, primarily on various drug and antibody testing projects. Additionally, I am responsible for developing standard procedures for NGS data analysis, including scRNA-seq, TCR-seq, bulk RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and more. I contributed lab-based NGS assay development including Drop-seq, Seq-Well, and Seq-scope.
